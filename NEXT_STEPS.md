- Agent Teams MVP
- run history query support
- API enhancement
- error handling hardening
- data model expansion
- quote comparison enhancement
- parallel team execution
- web dashboard mvp
- MCP / ERP integration layer
- expedite-options skill
- material-shortage-recovery skill
- capacity-rebalance skill
- supplier-followup-draft skill
- configurable rules / policy layer
- deployment readiness
- observability and traceability
- recovery planning team workflow

## Start Here

When a new Codex / AI session starts, do this first:

1. Pull latest `main`
2. Read this file
3. Check `skills/registry.py`, `run_agent.py`, `integrations/asana_client.py`
4. Start with the next unfinished roadmap item, or define the next roadmap phase if everything listed here is complete

## Roadmap Table

| Priority | Work Item | Goal | Main Deliverables | Depends On | Recommended Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ~~P4~~ | ~~Configurable rules / policy layer~~ | ~~Move decision rules out of hardcoded logic~~ | ~~Rule config structure, loader, tests~~ | ~~Existing skills stable~~ | ~~Codex~~ |
| ~~P4~~ | ~~Deployment readiness~~ | ~~Prepare for actual internal use~~ | ~~Runbook, config docs, server mode validation~~ | ~~API and error handling maturity~~ | ~~Codex~~ |
| ~~P4~~ | ~~Observability and traceability~~ | ~~Make runs easier to audit and support~~ | ~~Run IDs, structured logs, Asana trace linking~~ | ~~Audit log and API available~~ | ~~Codex~~ |

## Suggested Execution Order

| Order | Work Item | Why Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ~~1~~ | ~~Configurable rules / policy layer~~ | ~~Best next step now that the major P3 skill surface is complete~~ |
| ~~2~~ | ~~Deployment readiness~~ | ~~Natural follow-on once policy boundaries and runtime expectations are clearer~~ |
| ~~3~~ | ~~Observability and traceability~~ | ~~High leverage after workflow surface has stabilized~~ |
| ~~4~~ | ~~Additional planning refinements~~ | ~~Reserve for future expansion after core platform hardening~~ |

## Ready-To-Use Prompt For The Next AI

```text
Please start with /Users/brucetseng/Documents/Codex/2026-05-08/github-repo-https-github-com-brucetseng625/NEXT_STEPS.md

Repo:
https://github.com/brucetseng625-tech/manufacturing-agent-system

First actions:
1. Pull latest main
2. Read NEXT_STEPS.md
3. Confirm latest completed commit
4. Continue from the next unfinished roadmap item, or define the next roadmap phase if everything listed here is complete

Current expected next task:
If `09a695f` has already been pushed, start from the next roadmap phase after the recovery planning team workflow. Otherwise, validate/push `09a695f` first.

Requirements:
- Reuse the existing routing, schema, team execution, API, provider, policy, deployment, and observability layers instead of replacing them
- Do not re-open completed P4 work unless a new blocking issue is found
- Keep the unified schema, history, dashboard, CLI output, and Asana formatting behavior compatible
- Prefer minimal, incremental changes
- Add tests
- Update README and NEXT_STEPS.md if needed
- Run tests and report results
```
